# Modelling Gravitational Microlensing using SageMath

SageMath code I created for the 3rd year project BSc Mathematics at KCL. Originally, it was running on AWS instance with 16 CPUs and 32GB of memory.

### What is gravitational microlensing?

Gravitational microlensing is one of the methods used in discovering new exoplanets. A massive object bends and magnifies the light of a background object which allows us to discover the propreties of the lensing object through a noticable change in brightness over time.

### Project scope
In the scope of this project, I dealt with images which we can observe with 2 or 3 lenses.

Additionally, I compared the timing with Mathematica.

*For 2 lens case per image:*
Mathematica ~40s, SageMath ~30s

*For 3 lens case per image:*
Mathematica ~40 minutes, SageMath ~1h
